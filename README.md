# Screen-Dimensions â€” 2021 Redux
*A passion project reincarnating a lost Internet tool last seen in 2019*


  Since 2008, 16:9 has seen considerable adoption as the unlikely arbiter to a mix of competing aspect ratios, notably 4:3 (television standard at the time) and 2.20:1 (70mm cinematic film). But, technology and manufacturing have only sped up in the over 12 years that have since passed, paving way for a "new" (read: different) aspect ratio that has pioneered a variety of useful resolutions.

  In late 2016, I took a leap of faith and branched out from the 16:9-aspect ratio crowd, joining the *Ultrawide Master Race*, a group of enthusiasts who adopted a new aspect ratio early on. In the last 5 or so years, the interest for monitors with wider aspect ratios has grown [exponentially](https://subredditstats.com/r/ultrawidemasterrace). At the time, I recall how difficult it was to grasp the dimensions of this new 21:9 standard. Enter, *now defunct* https://www.screendimensions.com/. It provided a simple-to-use web-based tool to compare screens of any pixel and physical dimension.

  Fast forward to today and you won't find a trace of it anywhere, though a glimpse of it can still be spotted at the Wayback Machine Internet archive. Perhaps due to its incredibly generic name, it seems as though nobody knows it is gone.
  
  Now that I'm capable of rebuilding the web tool that helped convince me to switch to ultrawide monitors, I'm beginning solo development effective immediately: Friday, January 22, 2021...
